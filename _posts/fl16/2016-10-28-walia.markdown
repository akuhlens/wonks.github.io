# Abstract

In this talk we will look at the semantics of first-class environments
using a CEK abstract machine and how to implement them efficiently in
a RPython framework. We will start with writing a simple interpreter
in Python and then add a tracing JIT using RPython. We will then add
first class environments to our implementation and look at the
different ways in which we can optimize them.

RPython is a metatracing framework which automatically generates a
tracing JIT given a simple interpreter. RPython is currently used to
develop PyPy and Pycket which are high performance JIT's for Python
and Racket respectively. We will look at how we can use this framework
to implement a tracing JIT for our simple language while using similar
ideas as Pycket.
