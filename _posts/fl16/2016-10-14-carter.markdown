# Abstract

Nominal Algebra is a framework for representing languages with binders which supports reasoning about α-equivalence and capture-avoiding substitution. Moreover, it supports the use of metavariables in terms, which makes NA both a powerful logical and computational tool. It can be used to represent a wide variety of languages-- such as first order logic, the λ-calculus, or the π-calculus-- all of which may take advantage of the general properties of Nominal Terms.

These features make Nominal Terms and Algebra particularly suitable for quickly prototyping programming languages and logics, by amortizing the cost of implementing substitution and hygenic syntactic transformation.
